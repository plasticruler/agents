experiments in programming an agent

Most of the code comes from watching the videos in [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YHt0dtyf4uiw8tKOxQLvlW) playlist. All I did was rewrite it but used ES2015 and
 knid of spaced it out a bit to improve my conceptual understanding of the principles.

 It's far from complete and I'm known to check things simply in so that I can work on it on my laptop.
