experiments in programming an agent

Most of the code comes from watching the videos in [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YHt0dtyf4uiw8tKOxQLvlW) playlist. All I did was rewrite most of it but used ES2015 and kind of spaced it out a bit to improve my conceptual understanding of the principles.

 It needs a bit of a refactor and I'm known to check things simply in so that I can work on it on my laptop.

 TODO:
 - I read that a quad-tree might improve performance because it gets dog-slow any time you go over 100 or so.
